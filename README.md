### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm working as __Machine Learning Specialist__ for an Italian [streaming platform startup](https://www.vvvvid.it/). At the moment I'm busy with the design and the development of several Machine Learning algorithms, in particular in the Computer Vision field: image and video segmentation, video matting, video super-resolution
- âš¡ I'm very passionate about __Self-Supervised methods__, in particular in *learning useful audio-visual representations* using contrastive and non-contrastive methods
- ðŸ¤— Soon I will deepen the study of __NLP__ techniques
